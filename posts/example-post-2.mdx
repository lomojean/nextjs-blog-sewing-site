## Designing the ultimate jacket

My ultimate sewing goal has always been to create the perfect all weather jacket for San Francisco. It must block wind and provide a cozy shelter while still being packable and breathable. The Beachcomber jacket with the lined interior and the option for a hood seemed to fit the ticket.



I purchased 9 ounce American made twill from Etsy in dark navy and lightweight microfleece from Polartec in tomato red.
